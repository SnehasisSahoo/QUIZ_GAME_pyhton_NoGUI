# QUIZ GAME using pyhton (without GUI)
This a fun quiz game created using an open API on python. 
I am really proud of the Error Handling I implemented here, do try with all types of invalid responses, disconnecting internet whatever you want.
The API used here is from https://opentdb.com/api_config.php . It is a very simple and easy to use website for generating fun trivias. 
imported libraries:
* requests
* json
* pprint
* random
* html
* time
The .exe executable with icon is created using 'PyIntsaller'. 
The code is very beginner level, but still the code is provided. hope you enjoy it!
